If you're interested in joining the team, please read this page carefully. 

#### Important notes:

* Make sure that you **sign up for the mailing list** below. 
* UBC Chem-E-Car has four main sub-teams: Electrical, Mechanical, Battery and Chemical. You can be involved with one or more sub-teams. Our team leads have listed some tutorials below that they would like our new members to try out. Feel free to contact them if you need help.
* Email the Junior Team Captains, Abhi and Victor and introduce yourself, they'll provide you with more information on meeting times and answer any questions that you may have.

## 1. Prospective Members Readme

> Expectations and general information for new members

* Our regular meeting hours for the current academic term are listed in the <a href="/contact/"><b>Contact</b> page</a>.
* We value passion, commitment and dedication over prior technical experience. We will <b>never</b> turn away anyone who's genuinely interested in learning and contributing to the team.
* As a student-driven team, we understand that academics and schoolwork will be your first priority, and we do not expect you to work on our design team projects 24/7 and neglect your assignments.
* To be a valuable contributor to the team, you should have a strong sense of responsibility and the ability to work independently with minimal supervision. Your team lead can provide guidance and point you in the right direction, but you are expected to take charge of your own projects. 
* If you accept a task from your team lead, we do expect you to see it through to completion to the best of your ability, and within a reasonable amount of time.
* We <b>really</b> appreciate proactiveness. If a certain job needs to be completed and you can manage it, please take initiative and volunteer! If you think something can be done in a better way, teach us! Everyone is here to learn, irrespective of whether they've been with the team for 5 years or 5 weeks. 
* <b>We want to stress that: </b> if you have an empty plate and need more stuff to work on, <b>do not hesitate ask</b>! We always have proposals that need to be written, posters that need to be designed, sponsors to be contacted and many other tasks that need to be completed.
* Most students would consider joining an engineering design team to be a big commitment, and we tend to agree. Feel free to just drop by our regular meetings or events to explore our projects and your options, absolutely no pressure to commit for the whole term/year!
* We want everyone to learn new skills through our projects and have fun working in a team. But it is important to note that ultimately, your personal experience and what you get out of the team is what you put in.

> **Mandatory Certificates, COMPLETE ASAP**
 
1. Engineering Design Team Safety Orientation
2. Preventing and Addressing Workplace Bullying and Harassment
3. Chemical Safety Course

> **AIChE Registration and Safety Test, COMPLETE ASAP**
 
* Complete the <a href="http://www.aiche.org/community/students/chem-e-car-competition-rules/safety-training-test">Chem-E-Car Competition® Safety Training Test</a>

## 4. Electrical Tutorials
> Contact Ngai To at logistics@ubcchemecar.com for questions or if you want to join the electrical team.

The consensus is to focus on software skills, i.e. Arduino and general coding.

**Mandatory**
- Work through these introductory software and web development tutorials as fast as you can, let us know in the group chat if you get stuck. [Available on GitHub](https://github.com/ubcchemecar/beginners-tutorial)

* If you haven't, please download the latest version of Arduino: <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Download the Arduino Software</a> and take a look at the coding for an encoder wheel. You can [read more here](http://machinedesign.com/sensors/basics-rotary-encoders-overview-and-new-technologies-0").

## 5. Mechanical Tutorials
> Contact Kyle at mechanical@ubcchemecar.com for questions or if you want to join the mechanical team.

Try to get as familiar as possible with either Solidworks or Inventor before the next meeting. Note: You've learned/will be learning Solidworks in First Year Engineering.

* Download and install Solidworks (caution: 8 GB file) <a href="http://students.engineering.ubc.ca/success/software/">Download</a>
* Download and install Inventor (caution: 15 GB file) <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured">Download</a>
* Note: Chem-E-Car will be using Inventor mainly but will have some projects in Solidwor
* Solidworks : Please begin learning the program <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy3ExIAcI2Y">use this video</a>
* Inventor: There is a built in tutorial. Please try to <b>complete tutorial part 1 and 2</b> in the progr
* Try doing  <a href="docs/Alistirmalar.pdf"> excercises up to 2-4 in this pdf</a> using either Solidworks or Invent
* Exercise 2-5 is feasible but there are many shortcuts to make the pieces faster. Look up design tables, scale, or drawing relations, if you are interested.  

> Learn how to make a sphere
